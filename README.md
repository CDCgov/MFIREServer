# MFIRE Server
## Overview
MFIRE Server is a supplemental program for the VR Mine Rescue Training (VR-MRT) Platform. It runs a standalone instance of [MFIRE](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/tools/mfire.html) that takes the node-based ventilation network created in VR-MRT and runs a step-wise simulation to calculate the atmospheric changes over time and provides updates for the active VR-MRT simulation.

## Link to VR-MRT
Please follow the link here to the VR-MRT repository: [VR-MRT](https://github.com/CDCgov/vr-mine-rescue-training)

## Installing MFIRE Server
* VR-MRT build/executable: Copy the MFIREServerExecutable folder into the same folder as your VR-MRT build or executable folder within Windows Explorer
* Unity Project: Copy the MFIREServerExecutable folder into the project folder of your Unity Project, not within the "Aseets" folder underneath

## How to Use MFIRE Server
* Before running VR-MRT, run "MFireServer.exe"
* Ensure the MFIRE Server is running by mousing over the taskbar icons on the bottom-right corner of the Windows taskbar and verifying that the MFIRE Server icon is present and running
